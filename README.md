### Special Thanks To!
I want to thank Ray Wenderlich and its eminent team on [RayWenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com) to provide such high-level learning materials for developers. The basic structure of this app was founded on the second chapter of **iOS Apprentice** but it gets improvements and additional features in some aspects.
